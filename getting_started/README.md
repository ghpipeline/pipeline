## you will need python 3.10 - use pyenv perhaps to be able to install various pythons

## virtual environment
```
$ python3 --version
$ python3.10 -m venv .venv-3.10
$ source .venv-3.10/bin/activate
(venv) $
```

Once this is done, the proper version of python should be installed.

## install requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once this is done, all necessary packages for this project should be installed as well.
